Zymono is the industry leader in reporting software for video games, social media, schools, businesses, and more. 

## Zymono API

Our documentation is fully open source and that can be found at https://github.com/zymono/documentation

## Zymono on GitHub

We fully believe in transparency with our customers so at the moment our mySchool program is fully open-source and Zymono Enterprise runs on the same backend. However, our main codebase is closed-source.
